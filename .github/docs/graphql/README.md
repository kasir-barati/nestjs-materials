# Graph QL

- A [query language](./glossary.md#queryLanguageDefinition) for your API.
- A [server-side runtime](./glossary.md#serverSideRuntimeDefinition) for executing queries using a [type system](./glossary.md#typeSystemDefinitionInGraphql) you define for your data.
- The [GraphQL **specification**](https://spec.graphql.org) is open-source.
- [GraphQL is not tied to any specific database or storage engine](https://www.reddit.com/r/graphql/comments/1gr13y6/why_graphql_is_phrasing_being_databaseagnostic_as/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) -- it is backed by your existing code and data.

## My definition of GraphQL

GraphQL is a structured way of talking to the backend and asking for data or performing an operation in a specific way within the established framework of our backend. Meaning we ain't gonna let client to do whatever they want but will give them more room to play but will still have some form dos and don'ts.
